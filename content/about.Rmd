* Used Spatial references from Oregon Spatial Library, ARLIS,  and PCC Geography Department to apply mapping techniques such as select by attribute, spatial join, clip, and XY Table to Point, to investigate dispensary diversity in Oregon November 2020.

* Formatted, organized, added classifications, and geocoded a data table of about 700 rows of data from the Oregon Liquor Control Commission’s active marijuanna retail license. 

* Discovered more than half of dispensaries in Oregon are owned by a chain and about 10% of dispensaries in Portland’s Urban Growth Boundary are owned by one chain, Groundworks. 

* Presented virtually at GIS in Action on April 22, 2021. 

* Future plans to investigate dispensaries diversity using R Studio.
